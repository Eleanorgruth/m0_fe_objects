# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - I think I struggled with the syntax and keeping track of my curly brackets. In the terminal when I printed the first example of the object foods it all printed on one line but all other examples it would print on multiple and I'm not sure what the difference is or why that's happening.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - I take notes to absorb information, so some notes I take I don't look back on and they just help me stay focused and absorb. The notes that I do look back on and reference when writing code is code written out with comments and arrows pointing to different pieces of the code. For example, in the following code block I would circle `spoons` and `plates` and label them "KEYS".
  ```javascript
  var dishwasher = {
    spoons:5,
    plates:6,
  }
  ```

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - I try to solve the problem in code on my own first. I think that I'm still getting used to Googling issues. I find that sometimes Googling things makes me feel overwhelmed by how much I don't know, and sometime in examples code that I don't know how to read yet is used and I feel more confused. But trying to figure it out on my own makes me feel proud of how much I DO know!üí™üèº
